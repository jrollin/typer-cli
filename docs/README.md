## Documentation Structure

This documentation follows a **feature-based organization** aligned with the global CLAUDE.md workflow. Each feature has its complete lifecycle tracked in its own folder.

## Workflow: Requirements → Design → Tasks

For each feature, we maintain three documents following this progression:

1. **requirements.md** - **WHAT** to build (EARS format)
   - Structured as: `WHEN [condition] THE SYSTEM SHALL [behavior]`
   - Clear, testable requirements
   - Future phase requirements marked as FUTURE

2. **design.md** - **HOW** to build it (technical architecture)
   - System architecture and data flows
   - Implementation details and algorithms
   - Design decisions and rationale
   - Testing strategy

3. **tasks.md** - **Progress tracking** (discrete tasks)
   - Implementation status (completed/pending)
   - Phase organization (Phase 1 MVP, Phase 2+, Phase 3+)
   - Implementation notes and decisions
   - Test coverage details

## Documentation Categories

### Steering Documents (Persistent Knowledge)

Located in `docs/steering/`:

- **[product.md](steering/product.md)** - Product vision, target users, key features, success metrics
- **[tech.md](steering/tech.md)** - Technology stack decisions, dependencies, build tools, rationale
- **[structure.md](steering/structure.md)** - Architecture patterns, module design, file organization

These documents represent persistent knowledge about the project that doesn't change with individual features.

### Understanding an Existing Feature

Each feature folder contains:
- **requirements.md** - What problem does it solve?
- **design.md** - How is it implemented?
- **tasks.md** - What's done and what's planned?

### Finding Code

Module locations are documented in each feature's design.md:

- `src/app.rs` - Application state machine and two-level navigation
- `src/engine/` - Typing session core, analytics, adaptive algorithms
- `src/content/` - Lesson generation and categorization
  - `category.rs` - Category filtering (see [two-level-menu/design.md](features/two-level-menu/design.md))
- `src/data/` - Statistics persistence (see [session-storage/design.md](features/session-storage/design.md))
- `src/ui/` - Terminal interface
  - `render.rs` - Category menu, lesson menu, session rendering
  - `keyboard.rs` - Visual keyboard display
- `src/keyboard/` - Layout definitions and finger mappings

## Development Workflow

### When Adding Requirements

1. Identify which feature it belongs to
2. Add to `docs/features/<feature>/requirements.md` in EARS format
3. Update `design.md` if architecture changes
4. Add tasks to `tasks.md`

### When Implementing a Feature

1. Check `requirements.md` for what to build
2. Review `design.md` for how to build it
3. Update `tasks.md` as you complete work
4. Mark tasks as completed with [x]

### When Reviewing Code

1. Find the feature folder: `docs/features/<feature>/`
2. Verify implementation matches `requirements.md`
3. Check design patterns match `design.md`
4. Confirm `tasks.md` is up to date
